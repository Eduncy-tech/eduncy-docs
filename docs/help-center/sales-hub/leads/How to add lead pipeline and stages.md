### Leads Pipeline and Stages

---

#### Overview
The Pipelines feature in the Leads module allows you to organize your lead management process into clear, customizable stages.  
Each pipeline represents a complete workflow that matches how your team handles leads —  
from the first contact to conversion.  
You can create multiple pipelines to support different markets, services, or workflows.

Example:  
You may have one pipeline for Language Course Leads and another for University Admission Leads,  
each with its own stages and logic.

#### How to Access Leads Pipeline Settings
Go to the Leads page.  
Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.  
Select Leads Settings from the dropdown.  
The Pipelines page will open directly, showing a list of all existing pipelines with their stages and actions.

#### How to Add a New Pipeline
Click Add Pipeline at the top-right of the Pipelines page.  
Enter a Pipeline Name (e.g., Language Course Leads).  
Click Submit to create the pipeline.  
Once added, you can click Manage Stages to add stages.  
Each stage has a Name and Color.

Example stages:  
New Lead → Contacted → Interested → Converted.

---

#### Editing or Deleting a Pipeline
To edit, click the Edit (✏️) icon beside the pipeline name to rename it.  
To delete, click Delete.  
If the pipeline has leads assigned, the system will ask you to move those leads  
to another pipeline and stage before deletion.

---

#### Managing Stages
Click Manage Stages beside the pipeline you want to modify.  
Add, rename, reorder, or delete stages as needed.  
Use colors to visually distinguish between different stages.  
Click Stage Settings icon next to the stage you want to mark as the End of the Process.

#### Setting a Default Pipeline
When a new lead is created without specifying a pipeline,  
it’s automatically assigned to the Default Pipeline.

To change the default pipeline:  
Go to Settings → Pipelines.  
Click Set Default beside your preferred pipeline.  
Only one pipeline can be marked as default at a time.

#### Moving Leads Between Pipelines

**Option 1 — From Bulk Edit:**  
Select multiple leads in the Leads list.  
Click Bulk Actions → Move to Stage.  
Choose the new Pipeline and Stage, then confirm.

**Option 2 — From Lead Card:**  
Open any lead record.  
Click the three-dot menu (⋮) → Transfer Lead.  
Choose the destination pipeline and stage.

**Option 3 — From End Stage Popup:**  
Move the lead to the End of Process Stage.  
From the Lead reached end stage popup,  
click Transfer to Pipeline.  
Select the destination pipeline and stage to transfer the data to.

#### Tips & Notes
You can’t create two pipelines with the same name.  
You can’t delete a stage that still contains leads — move them first.  
The system always keeps at least one default pipeline.  
Only users with Custom Access to Leads Settings can manage pipelines.
