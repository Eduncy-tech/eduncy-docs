### How to Convert a Lead to a Deal

Converting a lead into a deal is the final step after completing all necessary communication and qualification.  
Once the lead reaches the final stage of your lead process, it can be transferred into the Deals module.

#### Step 1: Open the Leads Page
1. Log into your system.  
2. Navigate to the CRM System.  
3. Click **Leads**.

#### Step 2: Move the Lead to the Final Stage
Before converting a lead, it must be moved to the pipeline’s End of Process stage (e.g., “Lead Done”).

You can do this in two ways:

**Drag & Drop**
- Click and hold the lead card.  
- Drag it to the End of Process stage.  
- Release to drop.

**Move to Stage Dropdown**
- Select the checkbox on the lead card.  
- Click **Move to Stage**.  
- Choose the End of Process stage.

#### Step 3: Select “Convert to Deal”
When a lead enters the End of Process stage, a popup will appear.

In the popup:
- Click **Convert to Deal**.

This begins the deal creation process.

---

#### Step 4: Choose Where the Deal Will Be Created
A Transfer Data popup will appear asking you to select:

- **Deal Pipeline**  
- **Deal Stage**

Choose where the new deal should appear in the Deals module, then click **Confirm**.

---

#### Step 5: Verify the Deal
To finish:
1. Open the **Deals** page from the CRM menu.  
2. Search for the lead by name.  
3. Confirm it now appears as a deal card in the stage you selected.

#### Notes
