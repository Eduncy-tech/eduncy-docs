making it easier than ever to adapt the CRM to your exact business process.

Managing **Leads, Deals, and Applications** just got a major upgrade!

## Hereâ€™s Whatâ€™s New  

### âœ… Unified Access to Pipeline Settings  
Access Pipelines directly from the **three-dot menu (â‹®)** on each page â€”  
**Leads, Deals, or Applications â†’ [Page Name] Settings.**  
The Pipelines page now opens directly, displaying all pipelines, their stages, and actions.  

---

### âœ… Custom Pipelines for Each Workflow  
Create dedicated pipelines for different services, markets, or academic years â€”  
like separate pipelines for **Language Course Leads** vs. **University Admission Leads**,  
or **Applications 2025** vs. **Applications 2026.**  

---

### âœ… Flexible Stage Management  
Add, rename, reorder, color-code, or delete stages to reflect your real business process.  
In **Leads**, you can also set a stage as the **End of Process**, triggering a smart popup when a lead reaches it â€”  
allowing users to either **Convert to Deal** or **Transfer to Another Pipeline** seamlessly.  

---

### âœ… Effortless Reordering & Default Control  
Drag and drop pipelines or stages to reorder them by priority.  
The system automatically assigns new records to your **Default Pipeline**,  
keeping everything consistent and organized across modules.  

---

### âœ… Bulk Actions for Efficiency  
Easily move multiple **Leads, Deals, or Applications** between pipelines in just a few clicks â€”  
ideal for high-volume operations or seasonal campaigns.  

---

### âœ… Smart Conversion Flow (Leads â†’ Deals)  
When a **Lead** reaches its **End-of-Process Stage**, a popup appears allowing users to:  

- **Convert to Deal** â€” choose the target Deal Pipeline and Stage.  
- **Transfer to Pipeline** â€” move the lead to another lead pipeline and stage.  

This ensures smooth transitions between sales stages without losing data or context.  

---

### âœ… Unified Permissions & Settings Access  
All pipeline configurations are managed from the **Settings** of each module (**Leads, Deals, or Applications**).  
Only users with proper access rights can **create, edit, or delete** pipelines â€”  
ensuring secure and consistent management.  

---

âœ¨ This update makes **Eduncy CRM** more intuitive, flexible, and scalable â€”  
giving education teams total control over every stage of their workflow,  
from first contact to enrollment.
